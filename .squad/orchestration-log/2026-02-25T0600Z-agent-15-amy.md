# Agent-15: Amy (Tester) — Orchestration Log

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-25T06:00:00Z  
**Status:** DONE  
**Scope:** Combat system tests, item system tests, save/load validation

## Work Performed

1. **Combat system tests** in `tests/test-combat.js`:
   - Ability resolution (all 12 class abilities)
   - Damage calculation and RNG variance
   - Status effect application and ticking
   - XP/leveling mechanics
   - Boss behavior patterns

2. **Item system tests** in `tests/test-items.js`:
   - Equipment stat application/removal
   - Loot generation and rarity scaling
   - Monster drop chance and rates
   - Identification system
   - Inventory management

3. **Save/load validation** in `tests/test-save.js`:
   - Full game state serialization
   - Equipment persistence
   - Inventory integrity
   - Entity state preservation
   - Permadeath behavior

4. **Test infrastructure**:
   - Updated `tests/index.html` to include new test files
   - All tests use window.TestRunner framework
   - ~45-50 new tests total

## Files Created/Modified

- `tests/test-combat.js` — New
- `tests/test-items.js` — New
- `tests/test-save.js` — New
- `tests/index.html` — Updated with new script includes

## Test Results

All 45+ tests passing. Coverage includes:
- Edge cases (empty inventories, no drops, invalid equipment)
- State transitions (alive→dead→restart)
- RNG determinism in combat outcomes
- Multi-floor item scaling

## Verification

Test runner executes in browser and logs results to console. All assertions passing.
