# Agent: Howard (Rendering)

**Status:** COMPLETED

## Work Done

- Expanded combat phase detection to FOV range (prevents passive regen while under ranged fire)
- Added regenCooldown to entity schema for proper save/load persistence
- Removed 11 dead CombatSystem fallback guards (cleanup)

## Outcome

Combat state tracking now respects FOV-based threat range. Regen cooldown state persists across save/load. Code simplified.
