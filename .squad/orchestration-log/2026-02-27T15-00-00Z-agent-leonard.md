# Agent: Leonard (Combat)

**Status:** COMPLETED

## Work Done

- Refactored effect.source to effect.sourceId (lightweight IDs instead of full entity objects)
- Reduces save file bloat and prevents serialization issues
- Fixed boss telegraph kills to route through onKill()
- Ensures proper XP awards and loot drops on boss telegraph kills

## Outcome

Status effects now use lightweight ID references. All combat kills properly invoke onKill() handler.
