# Agent: Raj (Items)

**Status:** COMPLETED

## Work Done

- Fixed Scroll of Fireball kills to call onKill()
- Audited all alive=false sites — confirmed Scroll of Fireball was the only missing onKill() call
- This fix ensures proper XP awards and loot drops on Scroll of Fireball kills

## Outcome

All item-based kills now properly route through onKill() handler.
