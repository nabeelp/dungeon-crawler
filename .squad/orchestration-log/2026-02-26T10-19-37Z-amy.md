# Orchestration Log: Amy (Tester)

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-26T10:19:37Z  
**Agent:** Amy  
**Task:** Add regression tests for 3 critical bug fixes  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  

## Work Summary

Added 9 regression tests covering all three critical bug fixes:

1. **Status Effect Ticking (5 tests)**
   - Player poison damage per turn
   - Player bleed stacking and ticking
   - Player stun prevents action but allows world to advance
   - War Cry buff adds attack and expires
   - Poison tick respects defense

2. **Self-Targeting Abilities (2 tests)**
   - Healing without enemies nearby
   - War Cry buffing without enemies nearby

3. **Save/Load Reference Link (2 tests)**
   - Player position persists after save/load
   - Player status effects persist after save/load

## Files Modified

- `tests/` — 9 regression tests added (exact structure per Amy's implementation)

## Commits

- Part of final commit: "fix: resolve 3 critical bugs from design review"

## Notes

All tests use existing test framework and follow established patterns. Coverage extends to edge cases (buffed defense affecting poison damage, abilities with no enemies in sight). Tests verify fix durability.
