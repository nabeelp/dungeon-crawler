# Orchestration Log — Amy (Tester)

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-25T15:00:00Z  
**Agent:** Amy  
**Mode:** background  
**Status:** Complete  

## Deliverables

✅ Built test runner (test-runner.js)
✅ Test coverage: dungeon generation, game state, utilities, combat, items
✅ **85 tests passing** — all systems validated
✅ Test breakdown:
  - test-dungeon.js: 20 tests (generator connectivity, room placement)
  - test-gamestate.js: 25 tests (entity creation, item management, message log)
  - test-utils.js: 15 tests (RNG, distance metrics, grid helpers)
  - test-combat.js: 15 tests (ability resolution, status effects)
  - test-items.js: 10 tests (loot generation, identification)

## Validation

- All systems tested for correctness and integration
- No regressions detected
- Test-runner provides baseline for future development

## Key Test Patterns

- Seeded RNG for deterministic assertions
- GameState factory validation
- Combat resolution with multiple status effects
- Item identification across full game run
- Loot scaling by floor index
