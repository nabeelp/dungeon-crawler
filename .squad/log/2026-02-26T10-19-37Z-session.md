**Objective:** Implement 3 critical bug fixes from design review  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  

## Summary

Fixed three critical bugs affecting core gameplay:
1. Player status effects now tick every turn (poison, bleed, stun, buff expiry)
2. Save/load no longer creates split-brain player objects
3. Self-targeting abilities (Heal, War Cry, Divine Shield, Evade) work without enemies

Added 9 regression tests covering all three fixes. Cleaned up dead fallback code.
