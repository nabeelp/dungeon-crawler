# Session: Final Squad Merge

**Date:** 2026-02-27T15:00:00Z  
**Agents:** Raj, Leonard, Howard  
**Focus:** Critical bug fixes and architecture improvements

## Summary

Three-agent squad completed fixes for remaining critical and serious issues:

- **Raj (Items):** Scroll of Fireball now properly awards XP and drops loot
- **Leonard (Combat):** Status effects use lightweight IDs; boss telegraph kills route through onKill()
- **Howard (Rendering):** Combat detection respects FOV range; regenCooldown persists; 11 dead guards removed

All changes ensure proper kill handling, save integrity, and combat state consistency.
