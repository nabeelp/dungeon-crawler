# Session Log — Initial Dungeon Crawler Build

**Date:** 2026-02-25T15:00:00Z  
**Team:** Sheldon (Lead), Leonard, Howard, Raj, Amy  
**Status:** Complete  

## Summary

Full-stack browser roguelike built from ground up. All five core systems operational: procedural dungeon generation, turn-based combat with 12 abilities, enemy AI with 5 behaviors, item system with 50+ templates and identification, Canvas rendering with fog of war, game loop with save/load, and comprehensive test suite.

## Outcomes

- ✅ 85 tests passing — zero failures
- ✅ All script dependencies resolved
- ✅ Game loop functional with graceful degradation guards
- ✅ Save/load + permadeath working
- ✅ Item identification system randomized per run
- ✅ Combat fully implemented (abilities, status effects, XP/leveling)
- ✅ 10 floors, 13 monster types, difficulty scaling

## Next Steps

- Playtesting for balance (monster spawning rates, loot distribution)
- Tutorial/onboarding (class descriptions, basic keybinds in UI)
- Performance optimization if needed (profiling on deeper floors)
