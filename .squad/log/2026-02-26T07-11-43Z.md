**Ceremony:** Design Review  
**Lead:** Sheldon  

## Summary

Design review identified 3 critical bugs (split-brain player on load, self-targeting abilities blocked, duplicate checkLevelUp), 3 serious issues (Math.random non-determinism, 4-way vs 8-way movement asymmetry, distance metric mismatch), and several nice-to-haves.

**Overall grade: B+** — Clean architecture, but critical bugs require immediate fixes before new work.
